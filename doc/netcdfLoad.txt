[Description]

This program loads the contents of the given netcdf file into the wdb
database. The database must be up and running for this program to
work, unless one of the options --help or --list have been given on
the command line.

Note that you _must_ provide a value for the --configuration
option. This file specifies what data is supposed to be found in the
file to load, and how it should be translated. The file should be an
xml document, conforming to the xsd document found under
PREFIX/etc/netcdfLoad/netcdfLoad.configuration.xsd. The xsd file
should be reasonably easy to understand if you are familiar with the
xsd format, and there is some inline documentation there. You can also
find examples in the same directory.

[Exit Status]

netcdfLoad returns 0 to the shell if it finished normally and 1 if a
fatal error occured during loading (out of memory, files not found,
database not found, etc.). Note that not being able to load a field is
not considered a fatal error; in such cases, netcdfLoad simply logs a
warning or error to the log and tries to load the next field.
