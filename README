WDB is a database system for storage and retrieval of weather and 
water observations and forecasts. It handles both gridded data
(raster) and point data.

This is a program for loading data from a netcdf file into a wdb database.

Note that when attempting to load a new type of netcdf file, you will almost 
certainly need to update the configuration files and/or the source code.

It uses libfimex to read netcdf files and to extract metadata from CDM modell.

Make sure that your development environment is properly set.
If not, try using something like this:
export LOCAL_PATH=<some-local-path>
export LIBRARY_PATH=$LOCAL_PATH/lib
export C_INCLUDE_PATH=$LOCAL_PATH/include/
export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=$LOCAL_PATH/include/
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LOCAL_PATH/lib
export wdbload_CFLAGS=-I$LOCAL_PATH/include
export wdbload_LIBS=-lwdbLoad
